# MAGIS Business - Enterprise AI Network

## 🌐 **Vision: The Universal Business AI Ecosystem**

MAGIS Business transforms individual AI assistants into an interconnected network of intelligent business agents that can coordinate seamlessly across industries, creating the world's first AI-to-AI commerce ecosystem.

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

While MAGIS Personal manages individual lives, MAGIS Business creates intelligent business entities that can:
- **Communicate with each other** in real-time
- **Negotiate and coordinate** services automatically
- **Integrate with existing systems** (scheduling, inventory, payments, logistics)
- **Operate 24/7** without human intervention
- **Learn and adapt** to business patterns and customer preferences

  businessDomain: "healthcare" | "transport" | "retail" | "food" | "services",
  payload: {
    service: string,
    parameters: object,

class MagisNetworkOrchestrator {
  async coordinateMultiBusinessRequest(
    userRequest: UserIntent,
    involvedBusinesses: MagisBusinessProfile[]
  ): Promise<CoordinatedResponse> {
    
    // 1. Analyze request complexity
    const coordinationPlan = await this.createCoordinationPlan(userRequest);
    
    // 2. Initiate parallel negotiations
    const negotiations = await Promise.all(
      involvedBusinesses.map(business => 
        this.negotiateWithBusiness(business, coordinationPlan)
      )
    );
    
    // 3. Optimize across all responses
    const optimizedPlan = await this.optimizeMultiBusinessPlan(negotiations);
