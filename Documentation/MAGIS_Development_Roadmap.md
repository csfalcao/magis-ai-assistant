  async trackExperienceCompletion(experienceId: Id<"experiences">): Promise<void> {
    const experience = await this.getExperience(experienceId);
    const followUpTiming = this.calculateFollowUpTiming(experience);
    await this.scheduleFollowUp(experience, followUpTiming);
  }
  
  // Natural follow-up generation
  async generateNaturalFollowUp(experience: Experience): Promise<string> {

### **2.3 MCP Ecosystem Integration (Apr 2025)**
**Objective**: Transform MAGIS into central intelligence hub for entire digital ecosystem

#### MCP Integration Strategy
**Philosophy**: Seamless integration of user's digital life through Model Context Protocol servers, enabling proactive intelligence and contextual awareness across all platforms.

#### Priority Matrix

**Phase 2A - Essential Context (High Priority)**
```typescript
// Core MCP integrations for immediate impact
interface EssentialMCPServers {
  calendar: GoogleCalendarMCP | AppleCalendarMCP;
  email: GmailMCP | OutlookMCP;
  tasks: TodoistMCP | NotionMCP | LinearMCP;
  location: GoogleMapsMCP | AppleMapsMCP;
}

// Example proactive intelligence
MAGIS: "You have a dentist appointment in 2 hours. Should I call an Uber? 
       Traffic is heavy on your usual route, but there's a faster alternative."
```

**Phase 2B - Lifestyle Intelligence (Medium Priority)**
```typescript
interface LifestyleMCPServers {
  health: AppleHealthMCP | GoogleFitMCP;
  media: SpotifyMCP | AppleMusicMCP;
  finance: BankMCP | MintMCP | ExpenseTrackingMCP;
  home: HomeAssistantMCP | PhilipsHueMCP;
}

// Example cross-context intelligence
MAGIS: "I noticed you've been stressed this week (heart rate data) and have
       back-to-back meetings. Want me to reschedule your gym session to tomorrow
       and order your usual comfort meal for tonight?"
```

**Phase 2C - Advanced Ecosystem (Future Enhancement)**
```typescript
interface AdvancedMCPServers {
  commerce: AmazonMCP | ShoppingMCP;
  transport: UberMCP | LyftMCP;
  cloud: GoogleDriveMCP | DropboxMCP;
  devices: PhoneMCP | WearableMCP;
}
```

#### Implementation Approach
**Natural Integration Philosophy**:
- **No API Overload**: MCP data enhances conversation, doesn't dominate it
- **Proactive Intelligence**: "I noticed..." not "Your calendar shows..."
- **Privacy First**: User controls what data MAGIS accesses
- **Contextual Awareness**: Right information at the right moment

#### Example MCP-Enhanced Conversations
```
User: "I'm feeling overwhelmed this week"
MAGIS: "I can see why - you have 15 meetings scheduled and only 2 hours of 
       free time. Want me to suggest which meetings might be reschedulable?"
       
User: "I need to buy groceries"  
MAGIS: "I noticed you're near Whole Foods and have 30 minutes before your
       next meeting. Should I create a grocery list based on what you usually buy?"
```

#### Success Criteria
- üìä **Unified Intelligence**: MAGIS has contextual awareness across all major platforms
- ü§ñ **Proactive Assistance**: Natural suggestions based on real-time data
- üîí **Privacy Control**: User can granularly control data access
- üîÑ **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: Understanding relationships between different data sources
- üí¨ **Natural Integration**: MCP data feels conversational, not robotic
