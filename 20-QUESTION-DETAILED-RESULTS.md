## üéØ Key Success Patterns

### What MAGIS Does Brilliantly:
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: "Do I have a healthcare provider?" ‚Üí Perfect dentist identification

4. **Relationship Intelligence**: Correctly identified Sarah as "friend" from context
5. **Recency Reasoning**: Chose Microsoft over Google for current job

### What MAGIS Struggles With:
1. **Cross-Context Learning**: Cannot find health info when asking about dental visits

3. **Temporal Calculations**: Cannot reason about "coming up soon" relative to current date
4. **Memory Prioritization**: Sometimes retrieves wrong memories for temporal queries
5. **Context Switching**: Work stress query returned job change instead of stress info
