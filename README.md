## 🎯 **Quick Start for Claude Code**

### **1. First, Read These (15 minutes):**
1. `claude.md` - Project overview and instructions
2. `implementation-timeline.md` - 4-day development plan
3. `tech-stack.md` - Why we chose this stack

### **2. Then, Understand the Core Features (22 minutes):**
1. `rag-system.md` - How memory and learning works
2. `proactive-conversations.md` - Natural follow-up system

### **3. For Implementation (20 minutes):**
1. `architecture.md` - System design
2. `schema.md` - Database structure
3. `deployment.md` - Setup instructions

### **4. For Inspiration (15 minutes):**
1. `examples.md` - See MAGIS in action

**Total reading time: ~1 hour for complete understanding**

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Setup (Day 1)**
1. Read `claude.md` and `deployment.md`
2. Follow setup instructions
3. Initialize project structure
4. Configure environment

### **Phase 2: Core Development (Days 1-3)**
1. Reference `implementation-timeline.md` for daily tasks
2. Use `schema.md` for database structure
3. Follow `architecture.md` for system design
4. Implement according to `tech-stack.md` decisions

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Days 3-4)**
1. Implement RAG system per `rag-system.md`
2. Build proactive conversations per `proactive-conversations.md`
3. Test scenarios from `examples.md`

### **Phase 4: Deployment (Day 4)**
1. Follow `deployment.md` for production setup
2. Verify all features working
3. Complete testing checklist

## 🎯 **Key Success Criteria**

By the end of 4 days, MAGIS should:
- ✅ Handle natural voice conversations across contexts
- ✅ Remember and learn from every interaction (RAG)
- ✅ Proactively follow up on experiences naturally
- ✅ Demonstrate genuine personal relationship building
- ✅ Feel like a caring personal companion

## 💡 **Implementation Tips**

### **For Claude Code Development:**
- Start with `claude.md` for context
- Reference `schema.md` when creating database functions
- Use `examples.md` to understand expected behavior
- Follow `implementation-timeline.md` for prioritization

### **Best Practices:**
- Implement features in order of the timeline
- Test each component thoroughly
- Use TypeScript for full type safety
- Leverage Convex MCP integration for debugging

### **When Stuck:**
- Check `examples.md` for similar scenarios
- Review `architecture.md` for system design
- Consult `tech-stack.md` for technology decisions
- Reference `deployment.md` for configuration issues

## 🚀 **Ready to Build**

You now have everything needed to build MAGIS - a revolutionary personal AI assistant that:

- **Remembers everything** with sophisticated RAG system
- **Learns naturally** from every conversation
- **Cares proactively** with natural follow-ups
- **Adapts intelligently** across work/personal/family contexts
- **Builds genuine relationships** over time

**Start with `claude.md` and begin building the future of personal AI assistance!** 🎯✨
