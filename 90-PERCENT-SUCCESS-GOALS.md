## üéØ Goal Tracking: 4/4 Failing Tests to Fix

### **Goal 1/4: Sarah Meeting Disambiguation** ‚ùå
**Test**: TEST 4/20  
**Query**: "When is my meeting with Sarah?"  
**Expected**: Friday at 2pm  
**Current Result**: Retrieved dinner memory instead of meeting memory  
**Status**: PENDING ANALYSIS  

**Problem Analysis**:
- Enhanced search returned dining memory: "Had dinner with my friend Sarah at Luigi's restaurant downtown last night"
- Correct memory exists: "Meeting with Sarah next Friday at 2pm downtown to discuss the wedding plans"
- **Root Cause**: Entity matching (Sarah) but wrong context selection (dinner vs meeting)

---

### **Goal 2/4: Passport Temporal Memory Selection** ‚ùå
**Test**: TEST 5/20  
**Query**: "When do I need to renew my passport?"  
**Expected**: next month  
**Current Result**: Retrieved wrong temporal memory about dentist  
**Status**: PENDING  

**Problem Analysis**:
- Enhanced search returned: "I need to go to the dentist next Friday at 2 PM downtown with Dr. Smith"
- Correct memory exists: "Need to renew my passport next month before the Europe trip"
- **Root Cause**: Temporal keyword matching failed, wrong "need to" context

---

### **Goal 3/4: Preference vs Experience Classification** ‚ùå
**Test**: TEST 11/20  
**Query**: "What kind of restaurants do I prefer?"  
**Expected**: quick service or reservations  
**Current Result**: Retrieved dining experience instead of preference  
**Status**: PENDING  

**Problem Analysis**:
- Enhanced search returned: "Had an amazing sushi dinner at Nobu last night with incredible yellowtail"
- Correct memory exists: "I hate waiting at restaurants, prefer places with quick service or reservations"
- **Root Cause**: No query intent classification (PREFERENCE vs EXPERIENCE)

---

### **Goal 4/4: Job Conflict Resolution** ‚ùå
**Test**: TEST 12/20 & TEST 17/20  
**Query**: "What's my current job?" / "Where do I currently work?"  
**Expected**: Microsoft/Azure  
**Current Result**: Retrieved older Google memory  
**Status**: PENDING  

**Problem Analysis**:
- Enhanced search returned: "I work at Google as a software engineer in the Cloud division"
- Correct memory exists: "Started working at Microsoft last week in the Azure team"
- **Root Cause**: No temporal recency weighting for conflicting professional information
